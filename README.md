# Layer0 Connectors

Connector packages help build and run your app within Layer0. When you run `layer0 init`, the Layer0 CLI detects the framework used by your app and installs the corresponding connector package. For example, if you use Next.js, `@layer0/next` will be installed. If no connector package exists for the framework that you use, you can still deploy to Layer0 by implementing the connector interface directly in your app.

For more details on implementing your own connector, see our guide at https://docs.layer0.co/guides/connectors.
